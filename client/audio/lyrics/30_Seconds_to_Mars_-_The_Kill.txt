What&nbspif&nbspI&nbspwanted&nbspto&nbspbreak
Laugh&nbspit&nbspall&nbspoff&nbspin&nbspyour&nbspface
What&nbspwould&nbspyou&nbspdo?&nbsp(Oh,&nbspoh)
What&nbspif&nbspI&nbspfell&nbspto&nbspthe&nbspfloor
Couldn't&nbsptake&nbspall&nbspthis&nbspanymore
What&nbspwould&nbspyou&nbspdo,&nbspdo,&nbspdo?
Come&nbspbreak&nbspme&nbspdown
Bury&nbspme,&nbspbury&nbspme
I&nbspam&nbspfinished&nbspwith&nbspyou
What&nbspif&nbspI&nbspwanted&nbspto&nbspfight
Beg&nbspfor&nbspthe&nbsprest&nbspof&nbspmy&nbsplife
What&nbspwould&nbspyou&nbspdo?
You&nbspsay&nbspyou&nbspwanted&nbspmore
What&nbspare&nbspyou&nbspwaiting&nbspfor?
I'm&nbspnot&nbsprunning&nbspfrom&nbspyou&nbsp(from&nbspyou)
Come&nbspbreak&nbspme&nbspdown
Bury&nbspme,&nbspbury&nbspme
I&nbspam&nbspfinished&nbspwith&nbspyou
Look&nbspin&nbspmy&nbspeyes
You're&nbspkilling&nbspme,&nbspkilling&nbspme
All&nbspI&nbspwanted&nbspwas&nbspyou
I&nbsptried&nbspto&nbspbe&nbspsomeone&nbspelse
But&nbspnothing&nbspseemed&nbspto&nbspchange
I&nbspknow&nbspnow,&nbspthis&nbspis&nbspwho&nbspI&nbspreally&nbspam&nbspinside.
Finally&nbspfound&nbspmyself
Fighting&nbspfor&nbspa&nbspchance.
I&nbspknow&nbspnow,&nbspthis&nbspis&nbspwho&nbspI&nbspreally&nbspam.
Ah,&nbspah
Oh,&nbspoh
Ah,&nbspah
Come&nbspbreak&nbspme&nbspdown
Bury&nbspme,&nbspbury&nbspme
I&nbspam&nbspfinished&nbspwith&nbspyou,&nbspyou,&nbspyou.
Look&nbspin&nbspmy&nbspeyes
You're&nbspkilling&nbspme,&nbspkilling&nbspme
All&nbspI&nbspwanted&nbspwas&nbspyou
Come&nbspbreak&nbspme&nbspdown&nbsp(bury&nbspme,&nbspbury&nbspme)
Break&nbspme&nbspdown&nbsp(bury&nbspme,&nbspbury&nbspme)
Break&nbspme&nbspdown&nbsp(bury&nbspme,&nbspbury&nbspme)
(You&nbspsay&nbspyou&nbspwanted&nbspmore)
What&nbspif&nbspI&nbspwanted&nbspto&nbspbreak...?
(What&nbspare&nbspyou&nbspwaiting&nbspfor?)
Bury&nbspme,&nbspbury&nbspme
(I'm&nbspnot&nbsprunning&nbspfrom&nbspyou)
What&nbspif&nbspI
What&nbspif&nbspI
What&nbspif&nbspI
What&nbspif&nbspI
Bury&nbspme,&nbspbury&nbspme
