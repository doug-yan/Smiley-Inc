# Presentation Outline

#### Things to talk about

 1. Motivation for this project
  - Just something fun. Originally wanted to make it social and challenge friends and stuff, but not enough time.

 2. Challenges faced during this project
  - Time constraint, since we scrapped original idea and started this one late.
  - Grading algorithm. Difficult to come up with a sufficiently sophisticated algorithm that gives useful results.
  - Finding proper tracks to use for music. To use a song, we need the instrumental and an acapella track, which is difficult to find.

 3. Features to show off
  - Song selection
  - Play song/show off lyrics banner
  - Record user input
  - Show off visualizer that visualizes input signals
  - Explain grading
  - Show leaderboard

 4. Next steps
  - Pretty up frontend
  - More song choices
  - Program lyrics to show up on cue instead of doing it automatically (this would be an entirely other project on its own)
  - Refine grading algorithm(?)
  - Make it social, challenge friends, etc.
